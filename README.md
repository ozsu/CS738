Data Engineering for Data Science
=================================

-   **Instructor:** [M. Tamer Özsu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~tozsu/) (Office:
    DC3350)

-   **Lecture Room:** MC 2034

-   **Lecture Time:** Monday & Wednesday 2:30-3:50pm

-   **Office Hour** M 1:00-2:00pm

 

Calendar Description
--------------------

Introduction to data engineering issues in data science. Data management
technology objectives. Structured data management: Relational database
technology, database workloads (OLTP vs OLAP). Big data issues: dealing with
volume (geo-distributed, cluster parallel, and cloud-native data management),
dealing with variety (data type-native systems, NoSQL database systems), dealing
with velocity (streaming data management), and big data processing platforms
(MapReduce, Spark). Data preparation pipeline: data acquisition, data
integration (data warehouses, data lakes, lake houses), dataset selection, data
quality and cleaning, data provenance management. Introduction to several
current topics in database research, such as Large Language Models, vector
databases.

Open to Master of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence students and others
without an undergraduate course on database systems (instructor approval
required).

Course Logistics
----------------

-   This is a course that is specially designed for the data science program. It
    is an in-person course and no accommodations are made for remote attendance.
    Please make arrangements to attend lectures.

-   The course will use LEARN for dissemination of notes and for discussions. I
    have set up discussion topics for different components of the course. Please
    post at the appropraite forum and refrain from sending me email with
    questions; post them on the discussion fora.

-   I will be posting lecture slides on LEARN (look under Content/Course
    Slides). However, they may be posted shortly before lectures or sometimes
    even after a lecture. Some of them will be detailed, others just a skeleton.
    So, it is important to attend lectures to get the most from these.

-   There is no textbook for the course. I have started to write my notes and
    I'll be posting them here (look under Content/Course Notes). I make no
    promises about the availability of these notes for every topic -- I'll write
    as much as I can. I may assign reading from other textbooks as appropriate.

-   I intend to have guest lecturers for some topics and will update the
    schedule as I get them confirmed. These guest lecture material are important
    component of the course.

-   Some logistics:

    -   The lecture times are MW 2:30-3:50

    -   My office hour is on M1:00-2:00

    -   The TAs for this course are not yet identified. I will update the
        information on LEARN when I know more.

-   Final exam schedule will be announced by the Registrar's Office in due
    course and I cannot change the schedule. There will be no makeup for the
    final. You will need to take it the next time the course is offered (Fall
    2026).

-   There will be five quizzes in the course. These will be 20-30 minute quizzes
    and may be done online within LEARN (I have not yet decided).

-   There will be two paper reviews. The logistics of these will be revealed
    later.

-   There will be homework assignments for you to work through the material, but
    these won't be marked - they are for you to review the material. I will
    provide solutions when the deadline for working on them is completed.

-   Two 48 hour extensions per student are provided. They may be used on one of
    the two paper reviews (at most one may be used per paper review). Email me
    and the TAs at least 24 hours before the deadline to let us know that you're
    using it, and why. We will adjust the deadline on LEARN.

- Students can use generative AI tools as aid, but have to write their own text in paper reviews. These will be checked using appropriate tools.
